# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project consists of a client-side application built with React and a server-side application built with FastAPI. The main functionality of the project includes uploading files, generating answers based on file content using AI, and managing the uploaded files.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Client-Side Application**: A React application that interacts with the backend to upload files, ask questions, and manage files.
2. **Server-Side Application**: A FastAPI application that handles file uploads, processes the files, and provides AI-generated responses.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn
